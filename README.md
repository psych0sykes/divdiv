# dividv
### Visual Fundraising Platform
Built with React, Node, and a Mongo database; hosted on Heroku, payment processing by Stripe.

**divdiv is not processing live payments currently and is in development see "Payments" below**

### Live dividv?
Divdiv is still in development. While it is functional, the payment processing is configured in test mode for the current deployment. If you would like to start a fundraising campaign in divdiv and get some real payments, contribute a div or two to the [divdiv Live](https://stark-inlet-81881.herokuapp.com/canvas/5e42fa91e37841002acec6d6) canvas.

## What is divdiv?
Divdiv is a fundraising platform built around divs and canvases. To start a fundraising campaign, a user can create a canvas. Each donation the campaign receives adds a div to the campaign canvas. As more users donate to a campaign, the canvas will fill with color.

## Tell me more about the divs!
When users donate to a campaign, they get to create a div to be added to the canvas. Users pick the color, donation amount, and can leave a message with the div. Divs on canvas pages are click-able, taking users to a page for that div that displays the div, donation amount, message, and the owner's username. Divs make a fundraising campaign more social, and interactive for supporters.

## How about those Canvases?
Canvases are the second core building block (along with divs). A canvas is creative visualization of data, each div representing a different person giving their support to a campaign. Canvases are interactive, and users can click on any div in the canavas to learn about that donation. A canvas represents more to a campaign than the dollar amount of funds raised, it represents people coming together. People and their divs mashed together, as neighbors, with common values. Canvases make donating more social.

## Payments?
That's right, divdiv can process payments. But while the app is still in development, Stripe is currently configured in test mode. If you would like to try out the payment flow and start adding divs to canvases, use the following test card number:

 - 4242 4242 4242 4242

The number above will always complete the trasaction successfuly, with any combination of expiration date, cvc, and zip.
